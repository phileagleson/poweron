 Proj. 18.017 Release 2019.01 3/13/2019 kschweers.  Changed definition of name 
  and value variables to just CHARACTER with no length.  With long names and 
  nested arrays, the concatenated name could be easily truncated.

-Details:
 The variables defined are required for the following include files:
 RD.READ.PARSE.INPUT.PRO

 These variables are used to capture input being passed into the
 PowerOn as a Service specfiles. The variables are broken up into
 three groups.

 Those needed for specfiles that are receiving:
  single objects
  arrays of objects
  required by all specfiles

-Dependences:
 RD.READ.PARSE.INPUT.PRO
